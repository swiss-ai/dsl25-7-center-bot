- The Google Drive MCP server integrates with Google Drive to allow listing, reading, and searching over files. It supports all file types, with Google Workspace files automatically exported (Docs to Markdown, Sheets to CSV, etc.). Setup requires creating a Google Cloud project, enabling the Drive API, configuring OAuth, and placing credentials appropriately. The server can be used with Docker or NPX in desktop app configurations.
