## Key Components

### 1. Firecrawl Manager
- Manages web crawling with configurable settings
- Handles scheduled and on-demand crawls
- Processes crawled content into vector database

### 2. Configuration System
- YAML-based configuration file
- Global and per-site settings
- Exclusion patterns support
- Command-line management tool

### 3. API Integration
- Endpoints for triggering crawls
- Status monitoring
- Background task processing

### 4. Application Integration
- Graceful degradation if dependencies missing
- Status reporting in application status endpoint
- Scheduled crawling based on configuration

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies:
   ```
   pip install firecrawl==0.1.11 schedule==1.2.1
   ```

2. Configure in .env:
   ```
   FIRECRAWL_ENABLED=true
   FIRECRAWL_CONFIG_PATH=/path/to/crawl_config.yaml
   ```

3. Edit configuration with included tool:
   ```
   python edit_crawl_config.py add --url https://example.com
   ```

4. The service automatically starts with the application and crawls based on schedule

5. For manual crawls:
   ```
   python manual_crawl.py --all
   ```

## Advantages Over Simple Web Fetching

1. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Crawls entire websites following links
2. **Intelligent Navigation**: Respects robots.txt and site structure
3. **Efficiency**: Concurrent requests with configurable throttling
4. **Scheduling**: Automatic periodic recrawling
5. **Flexibility**: Site-specific configuration options
6. **Filtering**: Exclusion patterns to skip irrelevant content

## Next Steps

1. Implement analytics for crawl performance and coverage
2. Add support for authentication-required websites
3. Enhance content extraction for specific site templates
4. Implement differential updates (only store changed content)
5. Add visual crawl monitoring dashboard
